# Leaderboard

> this Leaderboard
In this repository I will set up a JavaScript project for the Leaderboard list app, using webpack and ES6 features, notably modules. I will develop a first working version of the app following a wireframe, but without styling. I will just focus on functionality. I will consume the Leaderboard API using JavaScript async and await and add some styling.
